# Optimizations

## Overview
This document details the various optimizations applied to the **Secur-o-aMA** project to enhance performance and efficiency.

## 1. Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Description:** Experimented with different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizer settings.
- **Impact:** Achieved a more stable training process and better model performance.

## 2. Data Augmentation
- **Description:** Applied data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data.
- **Impact:** Reduced overfitting and improved the model's generalization to unseen data.

## 3. Model Pruning
- **Description:** Pruned unnecessary layers and parameters to reduce model complexity without sacrificing performance.
- **Impact:** Decreased model size and inference time, making the model more efficient for deployment.

## 4. Early Stopping
- **Description:** Implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting during training.
- **Impact:** Improved model generalization and reduced training time.

## 5. Parallel Processing
- **Description:** Leveraged parallel processing techniques for data loading and model training.
- **Impact:** Significantly reduced training time, allowing for faster experimentation and iteration.
