## Overview
**Secur-o-aMA** is an advanced cybersecurity project that leverages Meta's LLaMA models to detect and mitigate cybersecurity threats. By fine-tuning LLaMA for specific tasks such as phishing detection, malware identification, and unauthorized access prevention, this project showcases the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) in the critical domain of cybersecurity.

This repository is designed to be both a practical tool for developers and an impressive demonstration of AI capabilities for hiring managers. It provides everything from raw data and model training scripts to comprehensive documentation on design decisions and performance optimizations.

In the `README.md` file, it's essential to include a **Prerequisites** section that outlines the necessary tools, libraries, and setup steps users need before they can run your project. Here’s what you should include for the **Secur-o-aMA** project:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. **Python 3.8+**:
   - The project is developed using Python 3.8 or later. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Git**:
   - You'll need Git installed to clone the repository. Download and install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

3. **Kaggle API**:
   - To download datasets from Kaggle, you'll need to set up the Kaggle API.
   - Steps to set up:
     1. Create a Kaggle account at [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/).
     2. Go to "My Account" and find the "API" section.
     3. Click "Create New API Token" to download a `kaggle.json` file.
     4. Place this file in the `~/.kaggle/` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).
     5. Ensure that the `kaggle.json` file has the correct permissions:
        ```bash
        chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
        ```

4. **Pip**:
   - Ensure you have `pip`, the Python package manager, installed. It usually comes with Python, but you can update it using:
     ```bash
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```

    
6. **API Access** (For PhishTank dataset):
   - You’ll need an API key to access the PhishTank database. Sign up at [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/developer_info.php) and include your API key in the `scripts/download_initial_datasets.py` script.

    
## Installation
To run the project locally, you'll need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Secur-o-aMA.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Secur-o-aMA

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
course venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also use Google Colab or GitHub Codespaces to run the project without setting up a local environment.

## Usage

### Download Initial Datasets
Run the download script to get the initial datasets
```bash
python scripts/download_initial_datasets.py
```


### Data Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script or the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to clean and prepare the datasets.

```bash
python scripts/preprocess_data.py
```

### Model Training
Use the training notebook or script to fine-tune the LLaMA model on the provided cybersecurity datasets.

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

### Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation notebook or script.

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py
```

### Deployment (Optional)
Deploy the trained model for real-time cybersecurity threat detection.

```bash
python scripts/deploy_model.py
```

## Dataset Details
This project uses publicly available cybersecurity datasets. Examples include datasets for phishing detection, malware classification, and intrusion detection. More details on the datasets used, including sources and preprocessing steps, are provided in the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.

## Model Training
The LLaMA model is fine-tuned using transfer learning on cybersecurity-specific datasets. The training process is documented in the `model_training.ipynb` notebook, which provides step-by-step instructions and explanations.

## Evaluation & Results
The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score reported. These results are summarized in the `evaluation.ipynb` notebook and the `performance_results.md` document.

## Design Decisions
All key design decisions, including the choice of datasets, model architecture, and training parameters, are detailed in the `design_decisions.md` document located in the `docs/` directory. This transparency ensures that the project is understandable and reproducible.

## Performance Optimizations
Various optimizations, such as hyperparameter tuning and model pruning, are explored to enhance the model's performance. These efforts are documented in `optimizations.md` in the `docs/` directory.
