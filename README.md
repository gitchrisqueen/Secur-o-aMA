# Secur-o-aMA

## Overview
**Secur-o-aMA** is an advanced cybersecurity project that leverages Meta's LLaMA models to detect and mitigate cybersecurity threats. By fine-tuning LLaMA for specific tasks such as phishing detection, malware identification, and unauthorized access prevention, this project showcases the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) in the critical domain of cybersecurity.

This repository is designed to be both a practical tool for developers and an impressive demonstration of AI capabilities for hiring managers. It provides everything from raw data and model training scripts to comprehensive documentation on design decisions and performance optimizations.

## Dataset Details
This project uses publicly available cybersecurity datasets. Examples include datasets for phishing detection, malware classification, and intrusion detection. More details on the datasets used, including sources and preprocessing steps, are provided in the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.

## Model Training
The LLaMA model is fine-tuned using transfer learning on cybersecurity-specific datasets. The training process is documented in the `model_training.ipynb` notebook, which provides step-by-step instructions and explanations.

## Evaluation & Results
The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set, with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score reported. These results are summarized in the `evaluation.ipynb` notebook and the `performance_results.md` document.

## Design Decisions
All key design decisions, including the choice of datasets, model architecture, and training parameters, are detailed in the `design_decisions.md` document located in the `docs/` directory. This transparency ensures that the project is understandable and reproducible.

## Performance Optimizations
Various optimizations, such as hyperparameter tuning and model pruning, are explored to enhance the model's performance. These efforts are documented in `optimizations.md` in the `docs/` directory.
